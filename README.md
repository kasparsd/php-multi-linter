# PHP Multitool ðŸ”¬

A docker image with multiple PHP versions and Composer v2 to install and run almost any PHP tool.

Similar tools:

- [`phpqa` Docker image](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa) which includes dozens of PHP tools.

## How it Works

- The [Docker image](Dockerfile) installs multiple PHP versions and Composer v2.

- The `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files are copied to the `/app` directory inside the container which is also configured as the `COMPOSER_HOME` directory.

- All Composer packages from [`composer.json`](composer.json) are installed globally.

- The `/app/vendor/bin` directory is added to the `PATH` inside the container so that all Composer package binaries can be run directly.

- The entrypoint for all commands is set to [`entrypoint.sh`](entrypoint.sh) which reads the `PHPBIN` environment variable value passed to the container and sets the `php` binary alias to `/usr/bin/${PHPBIN}`.

## Usage

Navigate to your PHP project directory and run:

    docker run --rm -v .:/code -e PHPBIN=php8.4 ghcr.io/kasparsd/php-multitool:latest php -v

where `-e PHPBIN=php8.4` sets the default PHP CLI binary to `php8.4` (during [entrypoint.sh](entrypoint.sh)), `-v .:/code` mounts the current working directory into `/code`, and runs `php -v` to print out the PHP version.

The following `PHPBIN` values are supported: `php5.6`, `php7.2` `php7.4`, `php8.0`, `php8.1`, `php8.2`, `php8.3`, `php8.4` (see [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)).

The default command is set to `composer global show -vvv` which lists all of the globally installed Composer packages:

    docker run --rm ghcr.io/kasparsd/php-multitool:latest

### Runing Locally

1. Build the image locally using `docker compose build`.

2. Run `parallel-lint` against the files in the [`tests` directory](tests) which is the default behaviour:

       docker compose run --rm -e PHPBIN=php8.2 php-multitool parallel-lint ./tests
